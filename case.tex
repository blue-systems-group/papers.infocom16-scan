\section{Case Studies}
\label{sec:case}

To see whether smarthphone scans can generate new insights beyond what are
already possible to gain from infrastructure side measurements, we conduct two
extensive case studies to show how smartphone measurements can: (1) improve
network spectrum management (\S\ref{subsec:channel}), (2) help network operators
make better spatial planning decisions (\S\ref{subsec:spatial}).
