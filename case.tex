\section{Case Studies}
\label{sec:case}

To see whether smarthphone scans can generate new insights beyond what are
already possible to gain from infrastructure side measurements, we conduct three
extensive case studies to show how smartphone measurements can: (1) improve network
spectrum management (\S\ref{subsec:channel}), (2) help network operators make better spatial
planning (\S\ref{subsec:spatial}), and (3) evaluate the impact of rogue access points
(\S\ref{subsec:rogue}).
