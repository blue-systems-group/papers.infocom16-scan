During the one minute it takes to read this abstract, 2~billion
smartphones worldwide will perform between 2~and~8~billion channel scans
recording the signal strength of nearby \wifi{} access points (APs). Yet
despite this ongoing planetary-scale wireless network measurement, today few
systematic efforts are made to recover this potentially-valuable data.

In this paper we ask the question: "Should the channel scans being performed
by smartphones be collected?" To address it, we investigate whether these
client-side measurements can produce new insights compared to what is already
possible using the AP-side measurements that enterprise \wifi{} networks
already perform. Beginning with two large \wifi{} scan datasets collected on
the \PhoneLab{} and \NetSense{} smartphone testbeds, we perform three case
studies, using client-side measurements to (1) improve AP channel conflict
graphs, (2) predict the impact of AP failure or overload, and (3) examine the
disruption caused by rogue APs within the enterprise network. In
each case, a walk on the client side yields valuable insights for the
operators of enterprise \wifi{} networks, and together our results
demonstrate the value of smartphone channel scans.
