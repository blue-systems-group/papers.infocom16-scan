During the one minute it takes to read this abstract, 2~billion smartphones
worldwide will perform between 2~and~8~billion channel scans recording the
signal strength of nearby \wifi{} access points (APs). Yet despite this
ongoing planetary-scale wireless network measurement, today few systematic
efforts are made to recover this potentially-valuable data.

In this paper we ask the question: ``Should the channel scans being performed
by smartphones be collected?'' To address it, we investigate whether these
client-side measurements can produce new insights compared to what is already
possible using the AP-side measurements that enterprise \wifi{} networks
already perform. Beginning with two \wifi{} scan datasets collected on two
large scale smartphone testbeds, we perform two case studies, using
client-side measurements to (1) improve AP spectrum management, and (2) predict the
impact of AP failure or overload. In each case, a walk on the client side
yields valuable insights for the operators of enterprise \wifi{} networks, and
together our results demonstrate the value of smartphone channel scans.
